data used to find and prioritize outstanding work:

- outstanding items in development/release-checklist.txt, perhaps consolidated
  into a score

- examine repositories:
    - uncommitted changes
    - unpushed commits
    - commits since last release tag

- recent incoming bug reports, cpantesters reports

- number of maintainers for this dist
- was I the last releaser for this dist?
- have I *ever* released this dist?
- proportion of releases of this dist that were by me?
