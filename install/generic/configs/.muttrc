### Guide to transitioning to mutt from thunderbird/kmail etc
#
# For interesting tidbits, see: http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/guide-to-mutt.xml
#
# Configure stuff in this order:
#
# 1. sendmail substitute (nbsmtp, msmtp):
#
#    .nbsmtprc:
#     auth_user = karene
#     auth_password = <password>
#
#    .msmtprc:
#     account default
#     host smtp.activestate.com
#     from ether@activestate.com
#     user karene
#     password <password>
#     domain activestate.com
#     logfile /home/ether/var/msmtp.log
#
# 2. procmail (see my .procmailrc for more info) for filtering mail into
#    folders for better usability
#
# 3. fetchmail (see .fetchmailrc)
#
# 4. mutt
#
# For testing fetchmail/procmail configuration, comment out "set daemon .."
# and run "fetchmail -akv" - this will not delete messages from the server
#
# You can fetch individual mailboxes from the server with
# 'mutt imap://mail.activestate.com' and then manually change to the 'Sent'
# directory (or whatever you've called it - see the 'c' command), then save
# all messages to a local file by typing this (annotations in brackets):
#     T.             [tag everything matching . - i.e. everything]
#     ;s~/sent       [save all tagged messages to ~/sent]
#     x              [exit without making changes]
#
# I used this method to fetch my sent messages, but used fetchmail to grab
# everything else - I moved all folders back into the inbox, then ran
# "fetchmail -a" to fetch the inbox (still with daemon mode turned off).
# Then when I was happy with how the filters were working, I uncommented the
# daemon line and ran 'fetchmail' with no arguments.
#
# I also call fetchmail from .profile.d/.../mail.sh because whenever I
# reboot my workstation, I forget to restart fetchmail.

### Opening URLs from mutt into firefox, by Dave Lee
#
#
# Add these lines to .muttrc:
#   macro index \cb |urlview\n
#   macro pager \cb |urlview\n
#
# The program "urlview" can be found at:
# ftp://ftp.guug.de/pub/mutt/contrib/urlview-0.9.tar.gz
# Install using the usuall ./configure; make; make install commands.
# "urlview" is used to parse out the URL and perform an action on the
# URL it finds.
#
# Now a .urlview file which contains the following line:
#  COMMAND ~/.firefox.sh %s
#
# Also create ~/.firefox.sh which contains the following:
#   /usr/bin/firefox -remote "openurl($@, new-window)"
#
# chmod +x ~/.firefox.sh
#
# If you want to open a new tab in an existing browser, try using
# "new-tab" instead.  As far as I know, if the browser isn't already
# running, this will _not_ start a new instance.  I could be wrong, so
# if someone verifies, please correct me.
#

### To do list

### Enhancements
#
# - shell prompt should show number of messages in (important) mailboxes
# cliffordh says to look at users/neilw/mailtools/nwmail - which is only for
# maildir format, so I'll need to write an 'ethermail'
#
# - cliffordh says to check out his new mutt.sh
#
# - should be able to keep banging space and circulate through all new
# messages in all mailboxes (perl hackers are lazy!)
#
#
# - vim's formatting is less than perfect when composing messages
#
# indexer:
# - should show number of new messages in this folder, and number of folders
# with new messages
# - indexer should (like my vi) never go to the bottom of the page; always
# scroll with a few messages below me, for context
# - 'date' should be 'time' if message sent today
# - highlight messages with 'important' flag
# - space and tab should go to next mailbox
#
# - bindings:
#   when first arriving in a mailbox, "half-down"?
#   need meta-b and meta-h back like I'm used to
#
#   in pager, j/k should scroll in message not between messages; use arrow
#   keys to move between messages.
#
#   need an alias for lowering pager_index_lines
#   "go to last message in index"
#
# pager:
# - keybindings should be more like less
# - <spc> when at bottom of message should act like tab - go to next newest
# - <spc> when at bottom of message and no new messages should act like c - go
# to next mailbox
#
# - colours:
#   normal text is okay as grey (i.e. default)
#   singly-quoted text shouldn't be brighter (white) though - this is
#   different on my home system than work, so term settings are partially to
#   blame here - therefore be explicit with colourings
#
#   highlight the header lines in bugzilla emails for easier parsing
#   ditto for perforce changes.
#
# - w and W should work as in indexer
# - and any other unmapped indexer keys...
#
# send hooks:
# - strip *-bounces@activestate.com/sophos.com from To: or Cc:
# - replace dev-chat@sophos.com with activestate.com
# - strip *-admin from mailing list outgoing messages
#
# mailbox hooks:
# - 'mailbox to save to' - for perforce messages that end up in inbox
#
# editor:
# - vim should not wrap so ridiculously (at something like 60) - instead use
# the standard 72.
# - turn off whatever's taking forever - is it just the spellchecking?
#
# PGP - set up, etc - http://codesorcery.net/mutt/mutt-gnupg-howto

# Problems:

# in mailboxes pmx-bld, p4*, ...:
#  jump to most recent message, not first unread
